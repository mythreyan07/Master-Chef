step 1) soak 1 cup of rice for 10 to 20 mins.

step 2) rinse the rice very well at least thrice to get rid of starch.

step 3) meanwhile pour 4 to 5 cups of water to a large pot and bring to rolling boil on a medium high flame.when the water begins to boil, drain the rice

step 4) add it to the boiling water.also add 1 teaspoon oil to the water, continuw to cook on a medium high heat.

step 5) keep cheking so you dont't overcook .this only takes few minutes .cook the rice .grains must be sepatated yet fully cooked.

step 6) Quickly drain the rice to a colander.Cool it until all of steam vanishes.Fluff it up with a fork.if the rice is perfectly al dente you can cover and set aside.this prevents the rice form drying & becoming hard.

step 7) while cooking chop the veggies:
carrot
bell pepper
french beans
chopped cabbage
green onions
green chillies
fine chopped garlic
step 8) Heat 2 table spoons oil in a wok on the highest flame add garlic and saute just for 30 to 40 seconds,till you get an aroma.

step 9) set some of the green onions aside  for garnish.add all chopped vegetables and slit green chilli.fry for 2 to 3 minutes.do not overcook them as we want them crunchy.but also ensure the raw flavor has gone from French beans.if you stir fry too long,scallions will lose their crunch.

step 10)Ensure the flame is still high at this stage.Add 1 tablespoon soya sauce and 1 teaspoon vinegar.you can add more or less to suit your tast.Any other hot sauces can be added.

step 11) The sauce will bubble immediately & begin to smoke.Then add cooled rice 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon black pepper.

step 12)Toss,mix,stir fry for 2 to 3 mins.tast it.If needed add more sauce & salt now to suit your tast.Remember thr entire cooking process should happen on the highest flame.Otherwise the moisture from the weggies can make the rice mushy.
